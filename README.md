# Password Manager Console Edition
### Welcome to [xRTRx](http://github.com/xRTRx "xRTRx") 's Password manager source code.
## Description:  
#### Manage and organize your complex passwords and keep them in one place. The password manager protects your accounts by using encryption algorithms. They scramble your data, so theyâ€™d look gibberish if anyone breaks into your password manager. This means that only you can decrypt and see them. With the password manager, you no longer need to reuse the same old password, either. You can create and use strong, unique passwords to make your accounts even more secure.
